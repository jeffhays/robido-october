<p>Robido is a collective of web developers and designers that push the latest bleeding edge technologies to the foreground of web development. We currently do contract work for a plethora of clients but also pride ourselves in being a development collective that gives back to Open Source projects and contributes to the knowledge of new young talent all across the web.</p>

<p>We're darn good at what we do and love contributing to the Open Source community so much that we make all of our non-commercial projects Open Source and available for download. Transparency is a big part of our business model and we love to encourage community feedback. Tell us what we can do better or even what you would have done in our shoes!</p>
